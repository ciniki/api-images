*alert* This module is still in development, still haven't
decided how to store the image information and what URL's are
required.

The images module is designed to store image references which can be 
used for anything within the framework.  The images can be uploaded to
local disk, or stored on flickr.

In the future images may be able to be stored on Amazon S3, smugmug
and other photo hosting services.  The hosting services of images
will be developed as needed.

By hosting photos on services such as these, it increases website load
time until we are able to store the photos locally in a cached environment.

A URL to each size of photo is stored in the database for fast retrieval 
and display.  This removes the necessity to lookup and/or calculate 
image sizes on the fly.  As much should be predone as possible.
